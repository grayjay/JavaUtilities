/**
 * A reentrant read-write lock allowing at most one designated upgradable thread
 * that can switch between reading and writing. Other readers can acquire the
 * lock while the thread with the upgradable lock is downgraded. The upgradable
 * thread blocks while upgrading if other threads hold read locks.
 * <p>
 * A thread can initially acquire the lock in any of three modes: read,
 * upgradable, and write. A thread acquiring an upgradable lock starts in the
 * downgraded state. All locks and unlocks are nested. This means that a thread
 * cannot acquire a write lock, then a read lock, and then release the write
 * lock without releasing the read lock. Calls to downgrade must be matched by
 * calls to upgrade. Calls to upgrade and downgrade can be interleaved with
 * calls to lock and unlock in any order, as long as the thread has an
 * upgradable or write lock when upgrading or downgrading. A thread with only a
 * read lock cannot acquire an upgradable or write lock. Any thread with an
 * upgradable or write lock can acquire the lock again in any of the three
 * modes. Acquiring a read lock after an upgradable or write lock has no effect,
 * though it still must be released.
 * <p>
 * This class allows {@linkplain Condition condition} waits for threads that
 * hold write locks or have upgraded.
 * <p>
 * This lock allows a running thread to acquire the lock without waiting in the
 * queue, unless the thread is acquiring a read lock, and it detects a thread
 * waiting to upgrade or acquire a write lock at the front of the queue.
 * <p>
 * This class is {@linkplain Serializable serializable}. It is always
 * deserialized in the fully unlocked state.
